# Solution 
- ltrace ./make_the_candy
- See that we need a registration.json file
- ltrace ./make_the_candy
- Need Registration on first line
- ltrace ./make_the_candy
- Need : after registration
- ltrace
- Need "True" after the ":"
- ltrace is successful ! 

So the file registration.json contains : 
{Registration : True}
